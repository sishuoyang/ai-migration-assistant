# Prompt 03 — ClickHouse Schema Design

You've now seen the full source schema and the query patterns. Design an optimised
ClickHouse schema for the `migration_target` database.

For each of the 8 tables, make and explain your choices:
- Which MergeTree engine variant, and why
- Which columns to put in ORDER BY, and in what order — show your reasoning
- Whether to add PARTITION BY, and why or why not
- How to handle any Postgres-specific types or features (JSONB, arrays, ENUMs, etc.)
- Any columns where the default value strategy matters

I want to understand the thinking behind each decision, not just the SQL.

Once the design is agreed, create the database and execute all the CREATE TABLE
statements on clickhousectl. Verify each table was created successfully.
