# Migration Guide — PostgreSQL → ClickHouse Cloud

This guide walks you through a complete Postgres → ClickHouse migration using the AI agent in LibreChat. Each step is designed to be completed with AI assistance — the agent has live MCP connections to both databases.

**Total time:** ~2.5 hours (all 5 phases)  
**Prompts:** Ready-made prompts for each step are in [prompts/](prompts/)

---

## Phase 1 — Environment Setup (15 min)

### Step 1: Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sishuoyang/ai-migration-assistant
cd ai-migration-assistant
make setup
```

Edit `.env` — add your LLM API key and ClickHouse Cloud credentials:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # or OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_HOST=<your-service>.clickhouse.cloud
CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_USER=default
CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_PASSWORD=<your-password>
```

### Step 2: Launch the playground

```bash
make up
# First run: Postgres seeds ~10M rows — allow 5–10 minutes
docker compose logs postgres -f   # watch seed progress
```

### Step 3: Open LibreChat

Navigate to **http://localhost:3080**. Sign in (`admin@playground.local` / `playground`).

**Select a model** from the dropdown in the top bar (Claude, Gemini, or GPT-4). The agent will not respond correctly until a model is explicitly selected.

### Step 4: Enable MCP servers

Click the **MCP** icon in the chat toolbar and enable all three servers below.

> **Important:** this step is required before sending your first message. The agent's migration knowledge (system prompt) is only injected when the MCP servers are active in the conversation. Without them, the model responds as a generic assistant.

- `postgres-source` — source PostgreSQL database
- `clickhousectl` — ClickHouse Cloud (read + write, DDL + INSERT)
- `clickhouse-docs` — ClickHouse documentation

Test connections:
> "What tables are in the ecommerce Postgres database, and what databases exist in ClickHouse Cloud?"

---

## Phase 2 — Schema Discovery and Analysis (30 min)

### Step 6: Explore the source schema

Use prompt [01-discover-schema.md](prompts/01-discover-schema.md) or ask:
> "Explore the ecommerce database schema on Postgres — tables, row counts, column types, and indexes."

### Step 7: Analyse query patterns

Open `queries/sample_olap_queries.sql`, paste the contents, then ask:
> "What do these queries tell us about the ideal ORDER BY keys for the ClickHouse schema?"

### Step 8: Identify migration challenges

> "What Postgres-specific features in this schema need special handling in ClickHouse?"

### Step 9: Generate a Migration Planning Report

> "Generate a migration planning report."

LibreChat will open an **artifact side panel** with a rendered HTML report. Use the **Download** button to save and share with stakeholders before proceeding.

---

## Phase 3 — Schema Creation in ClickHouse (45 min)

### Step 10: Design the target schema

Use prompt [03-design-schema.md](prompts/03-design-schema.md) or ask:
> "Design an optimised ClickHouse schema for migration_target."

### Step 11: Challenge the design

> "Are the ORDER BY key choices optimal for our query patterns? What tradeoffs should we consider?"

### Step 12: Execute schema creation

> "Create the migration_target schema in ClickHouse Cloud."

The agent uses the `clickhousectl` MCP to execute DDL directly — no copy-pasting required.

---

## Phase 4 — Data Migration (45 min)

### Step 13: Generate the migration script

> **Lab vs production:** In production, use [ClickPipes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/clickpipes) or load from S3. Here, Postgres runs inside Docker and isn't reachable from ClickHouse Cloud directly, so we use a Python script run locally.

Ask:
> "Generate a Python migration script to move data from Postgres to ClickHouse Cloud."

The script handles dimension-first ordering, monthly batching for large tables, and type coercion for JSONB, arrays, and ENUMs.

### Step 14: Verify the target schema

> "Verify the target schema is ready before we start migrating."

### Step 15: Run the migration

```bash
pip install -r sources/postgres/scripts/requirements.txt
source .env
python3 sources/postgres/scripts/migrate.py
```

### Step 16: Validate row counts

> "Compare row counts between source and target. Flag any discrepancies."

### Step 17: Generate a Post-Migration Report

> "Generate a post-migration report."

LibreChat opens an artifact with a row-count comparison table, a full object mapping, and a findings section covering type coercions and any anomalies.

---

## Phase 5 — Query Rewriting and Optimisation (30 min)

### Step 18: Rewrite queries

Use prompt [05-rewrite-queries.md](prompts/05-rewrite-queries.md) or ask:
> "Rewrite the sample queries for ClickHouse and explain any changes."

### Step 19: Compare performance

> "Run a sample query on both Postgres and ClickHouse and compare the EXPLAIN output and timing."

### Step 20: Create Materialized Views

Use prompt [06-optimize.md](prompts/06-optimize.md) or ask:
> "Propose Materialized View optimisations for the heaviest aggregation queries."

---

## Validation

When complete, compare results against the reference solutions:

- **Schema:** `queries/expected_ch_schema.sql`
- **Queries:** `queries/expected_ch_queries.sql`
- **Checklist:** `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`

Run prompt [07-validate.md](prompts/07-validate.md) to cross-check with the expected outputs.
