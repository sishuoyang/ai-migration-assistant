# Migration Guide — ClickHouse OSS → ClickHouse Cloud

This guide walks you through a complete migration from a self-managed ClickHouse OSS instance to ClickHouse Cloud using the AI agent in LibreChat. Each step is designed to be completed with AI assistance — the agent has live MCP connections to both databases.

**Source workload:** Web analytics platform (`analytics` database — sessions, pageviews, conversions, pre-aggregated daily stats)  
**Total time:** ~2 hours (all 5 phases)  
**Prompts:** Ready-made prompts for each step are in [prompts/](prompts/)

## Phase 1 — Environment Setup (15 min)

### Step 1: Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sishuoyang/ai-migration-assistant
cd ai-migration-assistant
make setup
```

Edit `.env` — add your LLM API key and ClickHouse Cloud credentials:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # or OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_HOST=<your-service>.clickhouse.cloud
CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_USER=default
CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_PASSWORD=<your-password>
```

### Step 2: Launch the playground

```bash
make up
# First run: ClickHouse OSS seeds ~12.2M rows — allow 3–5 minutes
docker compose logs clickhouse-oss -f   # watch seed progress
```

### Step 3: Open LibreChat

Navigate to **http://localhost:3080**. Sign in (`admin@playground.local` / `playground`).

**Select a model** from the dropdown in the top bar (Claude, Gemini, or GPT-4). The agent will not respond correctly until a model is explicitly selected.

### Step 4: Enable MCP servers

Click the **MCP** icon in the chat toolbar and enable all three servers below.

> **Important:** this step is required before sending your first message. The agent's migration knowledge (system prompt) is only injected when the MCP servers are active in the conversation. Without them, the model responds as a generic assistant.

- `clickhouse-oss-source` — source ClickHouse OSS database
- `clickhousectl` — ClickHouse Cloud (read + write, DDL + INSERT)
- `clickhouse-docs` — ClickHouse documentation

Test connections:
> "What tables are in the analytics database on ClickHouse OSS, and what databases exist in ClickHouse Cloud?"

---

## Phase 2 — Schema Discovery and Analysis (25 min)

### Step 6: Explore the source schema

Use prompt [01-discover-schema.md](prompts/01-discover-schema.md) or ask:
> "Explore the analytics database schema on ClickHouse OSS."

Expected tables:
| Table | Engine | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| `projects` | MergeTree | 1,000 |
| `sessions` | MergeTree | 2,000,000 |
| `pageviews` | MergeTree | 10,000,000 |
| `conversions` | MergeTree | 200,000 |
| `daily_stats` | AggregatingMergeTree | varies |
| `mv_daily_stats` | Materialized View | — |

### Step 7: Analyse query patterns

Open `queries/sample_olap_queries.sql`, paste the contents, then ask:
> "What do these queries tell us about the ideal ORDER BY keys and ClickHouse-specific features to preserve?"

### Step 8: Identify migration challenges

> "What are the key challenges migrating this schema from ClickHouse OSS to ClickHouse Cloud?"

### Step 9: Generate a Migration Planning Report

> "Generate a migration planning report."

LibreChat will open an **artifact side panel** with a rendered HTML report. Use the **Download** button to save and share with stakeholders before proceeding.

## Phase 3 — Schema Design in ClickHouse Cloud (30 min)

### Step 10: Design the target schema

Use prompt [03-design-schema.md](prompts/03-design-schema.md) or ask:
> "Design the ClickHouse Cloud target schema for the analytics database."

### Step 11: Challenge the design

> "Are the ORDER BY key choices optimal for our query patterns? What tradeoffs should we consider?"

### Step 12: Execute schema creation

> "Create the target schema in ClickHouse Cloud."

The agent uses the `clickhousectl` MCP to execute DDL directly — no copy-pasting required.

---

## Phase 4 — Data Migration (30 min)

### Step 13: Generate the migration script

> **Lab vs production:** In production, use [ClickPipes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/clickpipes) or load from S3. Here, ClickHouse OSS runs inside Docker and isn't reachable from ClickHouse Cloud directly, so we use a Python script run locally.

Ask:
> "Generate a Python migration script to move data from ClickHouse OSS to ClickHouse Cloud."

The script handles dimension-first ordering, monthly batching, and prints a `daily_stats` backfill query at the end (the AggregatingMergeTree table must be reconstructed from raw data rather than copied directly).

**Note: You need to save the script to your local folder and run the script manually in the next steps, not the agent.**

### Step 14: Verify the target schema

> "Verify the target schema is ready before we start migrating."

### Step 15: Run the migration

```bash
pip install -r sources/clickhouse-oss/scripts/requirements.txt
source .env
python3 sources/clickhouse-oss/scripts/migrate.py
```

The script prints a backfill INSERT for `daily_stats` at the end — run it via the `clickhousectl` MCP or paste it into the ClickHouse Cloud SQL console.

### Step 16: Validate row counts

> "Compare row counts between source and target. Flag any discrepancies."

Expected: projects 1K, sessions 2M, pageviews 10M, conversions 200K.

### Step 17: Generate a Post-Migration Report

> "Generate a post-migration report."

LibreChat opens an artifact with a row-count comparison table, a full object mapping (including the Materialized View and AggregatingMergeTree target), and a findings section.

## Phase 5 — Query Rewriting and Optimisation (20 min)

### Step 18: Rewrite queries

Use prompt [05-rewrite-queries.md](prompts/05-rewrite-queries.md) or ask:
> "Rewrite the sample queries for ClickHouse Cloud and explain any changes."

### Step 19: Compare performance

> "Run a sample query on both OSS and Cloud and compare the EXPLAIN output and timing."

### Step 20: Create a Materialized View

Use prompt [06-optimize.md](prompts/06-optimize.md) or ask:
> "Propose a Materialized View optimisation for one of the heavier aggregation queries."

---

## Validation

When complete, compare results against the reference solutions:

- **Schema:** `queries/expected_ch_schema.sql`
- **Queries:** `queries/expected_ch_queries.sql`
- **Checklist:** `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`

Run prompt [07-validate.md](prompts/07-validate.md) to cross-check with the expected outputs.
